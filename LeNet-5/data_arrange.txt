** Image Data **

- Each image is stored as a 32*32 bin file with only one channel (grayscale images)
- The pixels are stored row by row
- Bin files for images are stored under '/home/cong/Code/fccm2020/LeNet-5/data/testSet/testSet/image_bins'

** Weight Data **

-- The weights are flattened into a one-dimensional bin file
-- Flattening order is : kernel * kernel * input_channel * output_channel

out_channel_1:
[[k*k] (input_channel_1)
[k*k] (input_channel_2)
...
[k*k]] (input_channel_6)

out_challen_2:
[[k*k]
[k*k]
...
[k*k]]

out_channel_3:
[[k*k]
[k*k]
...
[k*k]]
